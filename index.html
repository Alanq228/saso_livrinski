                                    until it had been brought up to the proper caliber of customer service.&nbsp;

                                <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">Surprisingly, Branson recently revealed that Virgin does not put the customer first. In fact, Virgin employees are the company's top priority. That may sound counter to decades-old business wisdom, but it has worked so
                                    well for Virgin that Branson says he's surprised more companies haven't adopted an employee-centric management strategy.&nbsp;

                                    after that so. So we’ve got a very very exciting couple of months ahead.</p>

                            <p class="u-text u-text-1">Certainly it’s exciting and I wonder what you’re expecting in the way of consumer demand because really at Virgin Group it’s all been about disrupting the sector throughout your history where customers are under-served. But
                                in the field of space they haven’t been served at all. So does that make you nervous at all trying to gauge the market and just what that demand will look like.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="u-text u-text-grey-75 u-text-2">BRANSON: If I have a room full of 10 people eight out of ten would love to go to space. If they could afford it. And of those people who could afford it. Again it’s something like eight to eight out of ten would love to go
                                to space. So I think the market for people who would love to become astronauts go to space is gigantic. I think it’s up to us to produce as many space ships as we can to cater to that demand. And then we’ve also obviously
                                got Virgin orbit which is going to be putting satellites into space that should go into space either December or January. The demand for putting small satellites into space, it’s a gigantic one. I mean there’s a four and
                                a half billion people who are not connected so. So we’re hoping that we’ll do well as well.</p>

                <br>
            </h3>
            <p class="u-text u-text-2">BRANSON: So it’s taken us 14 years to get here. Initially the costs will go up. I mean it was 250 which trying to work out what price to put to that. That will stay up I think for three or four years while we whilst we recoup our investment
                and then it will start going down again. And I think ultimately you know we could be talking you know in ten years time maybe forty or fifty thousand dollars to put somebody into space and that compared with of the 50 million dollars that
                it costs on the Russian space ship is anyway more affordable for a vast majority of people but obviously not affordable for everybody.</p>

                                <p class="u-text u-text-2">BRANSON: We’ll see. I don’t think either of us. The safety is obviously number one priority. So neither of us are going to race to beat the other one. I think the reality is that is both of us are going to do extremely
                                    well at it because the amount of people that want to go to space is enormous. We’re not going to be able to build enough space ships to satisfy demand. So, if we both went up at the same day that would be great.</p>
